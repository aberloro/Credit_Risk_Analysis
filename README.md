# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Background
### Purpose
Machine learning can beleveraged to evaluate credit card risk, though credit risk data will be unbalanced (more good loans tha risky ones). The purpose of this project is to use different techniques to resample the data and evaluate which techniques produce better credit risk predictions. 

### Deliverables
 - 1: Use resampling models to predict credit risk: 
     - Oversample with RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
     - Undersample with ClusterCentroid algorithm
 - 2: Use SMOTEENN algorithm to predict credit risk
 - 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to predict credit risk
     - BalancedRandomForestClassifier
     - EasyEnsembleClassifier
 - 4: Written report on credit risk analysis techniques
